* I'm a new challenger, wants to be a Front-End developer, will finish js30 days, my github is [codeFreeman](https://github.com/codeFreeman)


## Alternative Implementations
Here are some links of people who have done the tutorials, but in a different language or framework:

* [Thomas Mattacchione](https://github.com/tkjone/clojurescript-30) JavaScript 30 written in ClojureScript
* [Dave Follett's](https://github.com/davefollett) blog series, [A New Vue on #JavaScript30](https://davefollett.io/categories/a-new-vue-on-javascript30/), where he explores re-implementing #JavaScript30 projects using [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
* [Akinjide Bankole](https://github.com/akinjide/JS30days) used Node.js with [Jade](http://jadelang.net) to solve the exercises
* [Adrien Poly](https://github.com/adrienpoly/javascript30-stimulus) a modest attempt to convert Drum Kit, Video Player, Local Tapas, TypeHead to [Stimulus JS](https://stimulusjs.org/) framework in a Rails App.

## A note on Pull Requests

These are meant to be 1:1 copies of what is done in the video. If you found a better / different way to do things, great, but I will be keeping them the same as the videos.

The starter files + solutions will be updated if/when the videos are updated.

Thanks!
